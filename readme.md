| Storage Factory| [view](https://github.com/AsyaMaior/foundry-storage-factory) | The `StorageFactory` contract is designed to deploy instances of another contract, `SimpleStorage`, which is intended to store a user's favorite number |
| Fund Me | [view](https://github.com/AsyaMaior/foundry-fund-me-f23) | The `FundMe` smart contract enables users to deposit funds in Wei, with the requirement that the amount must exceed a specified `MINIMUM_USD` value in USD. This project leverages [Chainlink Data Feeds](https://data.chain.link/) to convert the deposited Wei into its equivalent USD value. Subsequently, the contract owner has the ability to withdraw these funds. |
